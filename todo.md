add background pattern from subtle patterns





to whom it is, some short explanation of examples, etc..

It is worth talking to Hans about the potential of this BECCA tool in the context of other tools and scoreboards at the EU, national and local level.

D2.3 and BECCA publication: try to go for the article focused on the review of international guidelines while the BASE book could focus on the scores of the case studies of the review work. FFCUL is available to support both the scientific article and the book chapter. Hans consider that D2.3 can produce more that 1 article and it is a priority than the contribution to BASE book.

The BECCA tool should be a supporting empirically validated tool.

This could be improved with the EEA and the new tools but lets see (could be a “trap")


About the tool:

- Preselections: level of Adaptation (Nacional strategy to local measure implementation) - info is lacking in the spreadsheet (only used for the case studies). However because Hans mentioned that we should focused on empirically validated, probably we should stick with the spreadsheet data.

- Explanation of the scores and where to cut (now they are top 10). Probably have the read more.
 
- Present some BASE case studies that are similar to the ones that more similar (with information and contacts). We could use the CS one page being done by EI and FFCUL. Further information could be obtain in the CSLD

- BECCA presentation at AF2016 should include some of the discussion points in this meeting. Why it is new, why it is robust, who can benefits from using it, what can be used for, etc…

- In the results list, the shown results should start with "Criteria: XX" (I would suggest to skip the term: "Subcategory".)

- Furthermore, the "Category" might be just below the "Criteria" (at the moment, it's a bit difficult to crasp which information are the most important.) Furthermore, maybe "Category" could be renamed in "Main category of criteria:" (to show the interlinkage to the criteria)


- score: "High relevance", "Medium relevance", "Low relevance" instead of the score (as in some literature databases).
